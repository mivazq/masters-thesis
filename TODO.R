# TO DO FROM ELIE:
#     
#     - Show that it's still sensible to consider L within V as it is indeed variable.
#     --> Show distribution of %L variation within firm across years using Davis Growth Rate
#     (Y_t+1 - Y_t) / (1/2)*(Y_t+1 + Y_t)
#     - Try standardizing distributions of Y, M, L, V, before computing correlations (Y,L) to test for "variability" of input
#     
#     - Aggregate at e.g. deciles of markups per sectors, create network, check measures
#     
#     - Do not scale Y variable as it will remove variation in X across years
#     
#     - Interesting to show: instead of aggregate markups (which haven't really changed). 
#     show whether markup ranking positions within industries change across time
#     
#     - For magnitude: check what it takes to from from 25th to 75 percentile of X, 
#     explain that effect in Y terms. E.g. moving from 25th to 75th percentile of WSI
#     implies a 8pp increase in markups
#     
#     - Create tables where I show how estimates change with inclusion of FE
#     Start with FE only, add industry, then add firm. ONly select one interesting 
#     table to put in the main text. THe rest should only appear in the appendix.
#     
#     - Only main stuff in main text, rest in appendix. No tables with too much information,
#     make it easily readable.
#     
#     - To complement plots on network metrics distributions have a table on zeros (not shown due to log scale)
#     --> Remove 1 from KC_i so that no system relevant disappear with logs and plot is better
