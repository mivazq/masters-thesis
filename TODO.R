# TO DO FROM ELIE:
#     
#     - Remove samples part, simply move into beginning of respective estimation sections
#     
#     - Aggregate at e.g. deciles of markups per sectors, create network, check measures
# 
#     - For magnitude: check what it takes to from from 25th to 75 percentile of X, 
#     explain that effect in Y terms. E.g. moving from 25th to 75th percentile of WSI
#     implies a 8pp increase in markups
#
#     - Check if firms not in PA export more as share of revenue?
#     --> Maybe they are pure exporters and could be giving up productio domestically (so WSI goes down)
#     but markup might be high because they are exporters
# 
#     - Add information on "Movements in Within-Industry Markup Ordering" figure: 
#         share that stays in same decile, share that goes up by one, share that 
#         goes down byone, share that goes up (REst), share that goes down (Rest)
# 
#     - Include absolute numbers when comparing sets, mention how important 
#         intersection set is in whole economy
#
#     - Investigate how do two opposite effects of change in WSI diesntangle?
#         -> if competition exits WSI goes up and I expect markups to go up
#         -> if I expand production WSI goes up but I expect markup to go down
#             ---> Plot change in WSI vs change in firmsize, see what relationship there is
# 
#     - In regressions:
#         -> Create a dummy for "expansion of firm size" include in regression -> define firm size with cost to avoid including markup
#         -> Maybe include square term of WSI?
# 
#     
#     - Create vars: 
#         -> against how many sellers are you competing on average: similar to WSI but -> DONE
#         -> stickiness of relationships over time
#         -> variables with nr.sellers and nr.buyers -> DONE
#         -> share of buyers that only buy from you -> DONE
#         -> transaction per buyers, or the other way around -> DONE
#         -> changing definitions of WSI to include all potentinal buyers => assign zero! -> DONE
# 
#     - Other stuff: 
#         -> When saying "well known phenomenon" provide references



# DONE
#     
#     - Do not scale Y variable as it will remove variation in X across years
#     
#     - To complement plots on network metrics distributions have a table on zeros (not shown due to log scale)
#     --> Remove 1 from KC_i so that no system relevant disappear with logs and plot is better
#
#     - Show that it's still sensible to consider L within V as it is indeed variable.
#     --> Show distribution of %L variation within firm across years using Davis Growth Rate
#     (Y_t+1 - Y_t) / (1/2)*(Y_t+1 + Y_t)
#     - Try standardizing distributions of Y, M, L, V, before computing correlations (Y,L) to test for "variability" of input
#
#     - Interesting to show: instead of aggregate markups (which haven't really changed). 
#     show whether markup ranking positions within industries change across time
#       
#     - Create tables where I show how estimates change with inclusion of FE
#     Start with FE only, add industry, then add firm. ONly select one interesting 
#     table to put in the main text. THe rest should only appear in the appendix.
#     
#     - Only main stuff in main text, rest in appendix. No tables with too much information,
#     make it easily readable.
