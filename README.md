# Masters Thesis

I set up this Git alias to simultaneously push changes both to my personal GitHub 
remote repository as well as to the one I set up within UZH's internal GitLab

```
git config alias.pushall '!git push -u gitlab master && git push -u github master'
```

Find [here](Final_MasterThesis_MiguelVazquez.pdf) the PDF of the final thesis.
